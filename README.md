# Multiplayer Connect Four
## Description
### What?
Multiplayer Connect Four is our attempt at making an online multiplayer Connect Four game. Connect Four is a game that involves a 6x7 board and pieces of two different colors (traditionally, red and yellow). The first player to connect four of the same color piece either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, wins the game. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four
### Why?
We are making Connect Four a multiplayer game so that the two players don't have to play on the same computer.
### How?
Two clients will be able to connect directly to each other to play a game of Connect Four.

## Deliverables
1. Connect Four game (GUI) - allows clients to connect directly to each other to play, detects when a player wins, and allows the players to either play again or quit the game after the game ends.
3. Documentation

## Plan
- Week 1:
1. Prepare the Connect Four code we already have to add sockets
2. Find ways to optimize code and fix any remaining bugs (in particular - need to add solution for when no player wins)
- Week 2:
1. Begin working on the networking component of the game
2. Research as needed
- Week 3:
1. Continue working on the networking component (if needed)
- Week 4:
1. Complete the networking component of the game
2. Begin documentation
3. Start testing
- Week 5:
1. Debug and optimize code
2. Finish documentation if needed
3. Test more & ensure that every possible scenario is covered
